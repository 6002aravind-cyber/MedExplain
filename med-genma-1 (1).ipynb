Patient\n  - Caregiver\n  - Student\n\n- **Model-Agnostic Architecture**  \n  The backend logic is independent of any specific language model and can be directly paired with MedGemma or similar models.\n\n---\n\n## Reproducibility Note\n\nTo ensure reliable execution in constrained environments (e.g., Kaggle), this notebook uses a **lightweight placeholder language model**.  \nThe emphasis of this submission is on **architecture, safety logic, and decision flow**, rather than generation quality.\n\nAll critical reasoning components (safety checks, intent routing, fallback handling) operate independently of model size.\n\n---\n\n## Scope\n\n- This notebook contains **backend inference logic only**\n- UI components are intentionally excluded\n- No diagnostic or prescriptive medical advice is provided\n\n---\n\nThe following sections demonstrate the full MedExplain pipeline with representative test cases.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Why MedGemma?\n- MedGemma is designed for medical-domain language and safety.\n- Generic LLMs often hallucinate or overgeneralize in health contexts.\n- MedExplain uses MedGemma only when sufficient information and safety checks are satisfied.\n-The downloadable PDF enables auditability and human review, which is critical for medical AI systems.\n\nProblem Motivation\n\nMany users turn to AI for medical explanations, but current systems often:\n- provide confident answers with incomplete information\n- fail to escalate urgent symptoms\n- do not adapt explanations to the user’s background\n\nThis creates a safety gap between information access and responsible guidance.\nMedExplain focuses on closing this gap.\n\n\nExpected Impact\n\nMedExplain can support first-stage medical understanding for patients, caregivers, and students,\nwhile reducing unsafe or misleading AI-generated health advice.The system is designed to be integrated into telehealth portals, medical chat assistants, or educational tools.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Deployment Considerations\n\n- Backend-first design enables deployment as an API service\n- UI intentionally excluded for reproducibility\n- Lightweight models allow GPU inference on standard hardware\n- Safety logic reduces legal and clinical risk in production settings\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This notebook demonstrates the backend reasoning system for MedExplain.\nUI is excluded to prioritize reproducibility and evaluation clarity.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch\n\nprint(\"Torch version:\", torch.__version__)\nprint(\"CUDA available:\", torch.cuda.is_available())\nprint(\"GPU:\", torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"CPU\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2026-02-05T15:59:23.574129Z","iopub.execute_input":"2026-02-05T15:59:23.574526Z","iopub.status.idle":"2026-02-05T15:59:23.596270Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2026-02-05T15:59:23.574483Z","shell.execute_reply":"2026-02-05T15:59:23.595538Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Torch version: 2.8.0+cu126\nCUDA available: True\nGPU: Tesla T4\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch\nfrom transformers import GPT2Config, GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2TokenizerFast\n# ===== Model Registry =====\nMODEL_REGISTRY = {\n    \"medical\": {\n        \"name\": \"MedGemma\",\n        \"description\": \"HAI-DEF medical reasoning model\",\n        \"enabled\": True\n    },\n    \"placeholder\": {\n        \"name\": \"Lightweight Mock Model\",\n        \"description\": \"Used for reproducibility only\",\n        \"enabled\": True\n    }\n}\n\n# Create tiny config (random weights, instant)\nconfig = GPT2Config(\n    vocab_size=50257,\n    n_positions=128,\n    n_embd=64,\n    n_layer=2,\n    n_head=2\n)\n\nmodel = GPT2LMHeadModel(config).eval()\n\n# Use local tokenizer (comes with transformers)\ntokenizer = GPT2TokenizerFast.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\")\n\nprint(\"Local mock model ready\")\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2026-02-05T15:59:23.597150Z","iopub.execute_input":"2026-02-05T15:59:23.597405Z","iopub.status.idle":"2026-02-05T15:59:24.054995Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2026-02-05T15:59:23.597383Z","shell.execute_reply":"2026-02-05T15:59:24.054274Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Local mock model ready\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":25},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# ===== Model Selection Logic =====\n\ndef select_model(\n    confidence: str,\n    has_red_flag: bool,\n    is_low_info: bool\n) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Selects which model should be used for response generation.\n\n    MedGemma is used ONLY when:\n    -
